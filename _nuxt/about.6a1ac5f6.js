In that case, you can wait for a new mint. </p><p class="text-break mt-3"> NFTs created via the AlwaysLiquid platform are ERC-721 tokens, which means that they are fully compatible with OpenSea and other NFT marketplaces. You can list these NFTs on any marketplace, or send them to anyone without restrictions. </p><p class="text-break mt-3"> In addition to being liquid, NFTs also allow for social features. Minting an NFT unlocks a hidden chat room for that NFT, where you can chat with other NFT holders. </p><p class="text-break mt-3"> Brought to you by the <a target="_blank" href="https://punk.domains">Punk Domains</a> team. </p><h5>Useful links</h5><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/AlwaysLiquidNfts" target="_blank">AlwaysLiquid GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/punk-domains" target="_blank">Punk Domains GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://discord.gg/8dSrwrAQeu" target="_blank">Discord</a></li></ul><hr><h5>Feedback</h5><p class="text-break mt-3"> Feel free to share ideas, features suggestions, rants in our Discord. </p>',11);function F(e,s,A,x,$,q){const i=c,n=d,r=l;return b(),u(p,null,[a(r,null,{default:o(()=>[a(i,null,{default:o(()=>[f("About | "+k(e.$config.projectMetadataTitle),1)]),_:1}),a(n,{property:"og:title",content:"About | "+e.$config.projectMetadataTitle},null,8,["content"])]),_:1}),t("div",w,[t("div",y,[t("p",{class:"fs-3",onClick:s[0]||(s[0]=H=>e.$router.back())},g),N])])],64)}const L=h(_,[["render",F]]);export{L as default};
